  Kallo is an open-source project (licensed under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>) created for the <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/">2020 CongressionalAppChallenge</a>; thanks to Kallo, teachers can restrict and view their student's online activities
  which will lead to a much more productive classroom and a fair learning environment for everyone.

### Components
- [kallo-backend](https://github.com/kallo-project/kallo-backend) - Back-end
- [kallo-student-extension](https://github.com/kallo-project/kallo-student-extension) - Student Chrome extension
- [kallo-teacher-panel](https://github.com/kallo-project/kallo-teacher-panel) - Teacher panel

### How It Works
When a student joins a class session (using the class code provided by his/her teacher), Kallo will act according to the classroom settings. If "restricted access" is enabled, it will close all current tabs, open whitelisted sites, and block students from navigating to other websites. However, if "test mode" is enabled, it will do the same thing but, open the whitelisted site and put it into full-screen mode. Each student's current tabs, navigation history, etc. are all visible to the teacher via the "teacher panel."

### Inspiration
When we first brainstormed, we wanted to make an app that helps someone. Eventually, we narrowed down to education; we are in a time where everyone is taking classes virtually, which has brought a big ethical concern to societyâ€”cheating.
